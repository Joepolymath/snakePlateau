# snakePlateau
snakePlateau is a basic snake game, coded in a tutorial class during the codeplateau 2.0 version.
The purpose of this project was to apply the fundamental python programming principles and syntaxes we learned from the DG of PICTDA(Plateau State ICT Development Agency)
The project was built on the turtle library. Which is actually built on tkinter python library.

We as well decided to use a little bit of the indegenous nigerian pidgin english and hausa in the code, just to make things a little bit light and to prove that a good part of the codes and variable do not have to be python keywords.
